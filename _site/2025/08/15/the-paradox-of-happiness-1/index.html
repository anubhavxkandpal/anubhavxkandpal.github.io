<p>We approach solitude with uncertainty, as if it were some alien task to
master rather than a natural state of being. We run away from it and
fear it, almost as undesirably as boredom. We feel we’d be disconnected
from the world in our solitude but we consider what we would be making
space to connect to. Yet it’s precisely when we accept life’s common
sufferings, solitude among others, that the deepest changes take root
within us. This is why most people seek distractions and change; they
search for an antidote to their suffering—hoping to become some kind of
perfect and happy person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Men decide far more problems by hate, love, lust, rage, sorrow, joy,
hope, fear, illusion, or some other inward emotion, than by reality,
authority, any legal standard, judicial precedent, or statute.” -
Cicero</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They believe they do it for themselves but if they do not have viewers
to witness their happiness, the effort isn’t worth it—so in reality they
do it for others. Truth be told, most would be more comfortable in
misery, for that is an easier path. Consider the ancient Greek concept
of <em>eudaimonia</em>, which suggests that true happiness comes not from
pleasure or social status, but from living a life of virtue and meaning.
Yet modern society has twisted this notion, making happiness itself the
virtue we must chase.</p>

<p>Feeling above others give happiness this fake allure of being a higher
emotion and thus it is the emotion of the privileged. It is the law of
nature that happiness will always be transient. Most of all it is the
wealthy and privileged who are expected to feel it eternally and
maintain it. How should they do so with such a slippery snake—an
impossible task with such an elusive emotion. This leads them to chase
material solutions: clothes, possessions, and even surgeries that paint
an artificial smile of eternal contentment.</p>

<p>The obligation to be happy in this society that is convenient, affluent
and ever more status driven is something that would break the soul—it is
breaking our souls. Where our true happiness was once found in
community, relationships and familial bonds, we have given these all up
in order to chase the elusive beast of happiness. As the philosopher
Zygmunt Bauman noted, “In a liquid modern life there are no permanent
bonds, and any that we take up for a time must be tied loosely so that
they can be untied again, quickly and as effortlessly as possible, when
circumstances change.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry
past it.”<br />
– Søren Kierkegaard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all chase happiness because society told us to. We got these ideas
via Bluetooth. We thought it was a worthy pursuit, but those who have
truly attempted it—the ones who have gone beyond and played the
game—know it isn’t worth the effort. Happiness, so ephemeral and
transient, refuses to stay with us. This chase moves forward, realising
that happiness cannot be captured, to find a middle ground where one is
numb to nearly all feeling. Where happiness is no longer happiness, nor
what it used to be and sadness simply refuses to be felt. Thus, we
arrive at a ground where we are numb to all feelings and happy in a fake
exuberance.</p>

  <p>“Joy is the serious business of Heaven.” - C.S. Lewis</p>

<p>One must have people to show that one is happy. I doubt being happy
alone by oneself is worth the effort—but being joyful is. Joy, often
confused with happiness, deserves its own consideration. Being in a
state of joy is worth it because it is not dependent on externals and it
is not easy to discern whether a person is in a joyful state of being or
not.</p>

<p>Joy is something that isn’t created but <strong>revealed</strong> and allowed to
flood into our lives as we remove the obstructions to it. Rather than a
state of action or doing, it is a state of being. This is something that
is not easily made into a social requirement. Unlike happiness, joy
cannot be manufactured from activities or their results. It can,
however, emerge from repetitive activity and things that make no sense
but somehow have profound meaning for us personally.</p>

<p>The Buddhist concept of <em>mudita</em>—sympathetic joy—offers an interesting
contrast to our modern pursuit of personal happiness. It suggests
finding joy in others’ happiness rather than constructing our own
artificial euphoria.</p>

<p>For when joyful things are chased like one does with happiness, it
simply spoils the good things in nature and makes them into
resources—ends to be pursued not for the joy they themselves provide but
for their fruits. Creating happiness through experiences that arouse our
emotions and make us feel elated in a kind of surprising way, we feel as
if we may be happy—but truthfully, we cannot be sure.</p>

<p>High arousal emotions distract us from the other side, against emotions
that bring us down low. In these states of ‘high’ we find ourselves, so
to say, ‘on top of the world’. The real shame is why we do not realize
that, regardless of our experience, we always are on top of this world.
The emotions that bring us down make us suffer and we are not being
taught how to deal with suffering, how to make friends with it. We are
simply told to run away from it, to not stay with it or to use our minds
to trick ourselves into ‘thinking positively’.</p>

<p>It is in true suffering that we can experience a kind of joy that feels
confusing to the modern mind but deeply religious to the ancient mind. A
feeling akin to Christian grace or the Hindu concept of <em>Ananda,</em> the
bliss of the compassionate God, this subtle and rich experience is a
revelation of the interconnectedness of these emotions and what their
true and sincere experience leads to.</p>

<p>It is in suffering that the soul shines and finds its truth. And joy,
the state of being, much more worthy than happiness, is something we
allow into ourselves much like suffering. It stands to reason that joy
and suffering are the two ways we see the world, through our own eyes
and those of the mind. Suffering grounds us and joy brings us into
states of wonder, elation, awe and both can be associated with
transcendence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive
characters are seared with scars.” - Kahlil Gibran</p>

<h2 id="the-folly-of-the-happiness-chase">The Folly of the Happiness Chase</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1710163132381-5564b0777726?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0NHx8Y2hhc2luZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3MzE3MzA3OTB8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="a man walking down a street past a store front" />

<p>We must also wonder about art and if it can ever be fuelled by this
numbing emotion of happiness. The happy person rarely creates, much like
the despairing one. Neither finds anything in the world worth creating
or wondering about. Wonder itself cannot be manufactured like happiness;
it must be revealed. These higher emotions cannot be purchased, forced,
or created—they must emerge naturally from a state of being that
precedes them.</p>

<p>Conceptual thoughts fill a happy person as they descend into frustration
at the obviously absurd attempt to capture an always slipping happiness.
In a strange turn of events, they later welcome despair and depression
for these states finally offer this person respite and a ‘deep rest’
from this exhausting search for happiness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of
unhappiness.” - Eric Hoffer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the wisdom of the ancient Stoics, particularly Epictetus who
taught that happiness comes not from getting what we want, but from
wanting what we get. Yet modern society has inverted this wisdom,
creating an endless chase for more.</p>

<p>The pursuit of happiness parallels the pursuit of pleasure—both
inevitably lead to pain. The struggle to make these fleeting emotions
permanent and become part of our empty lives reveals the
shortsightedness of modern society’s obsession with progress and
rationality. As philosopher Albert Camus noted, “You will never be happy
if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never
live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”</p>

<p>Few will admit to the emptiness of this search, as doing so means
challenging society itself—something most are unwilling to do since they
derive their identity from it. No one can tell a seeker of happiness
otherwise, for then they are offending them, keeping them from the goal
of submerging themselves in an everlasting sea of positivity. Strangely
enough, even trials and failures will not deter the seeker but only make
their resolve stronger, believing the difficulty of their path is
because the prize is valuable. So they will never admit to the folly and
emptiness of this search, even if they have felt it. To admit that this
search is wrong is to admit society is wrong and to rebuke something
larger than ourselves in such a callous manner is something most people
are not willing to do.</p>

<p>It is normal that most people derive their sense of identity from
society. Only the rare few—those who might seem cursed rather than
privileged—must forge their own identity. Yet in this apparent curse
lies a hidden blessing, a paradox like the privilege of the perpetually
happy person becoming their prison.</p>

<p>This paradox recalls the ancient Zen koan:<br />
A monk asked his master, “What is happiness?”<br />
The master replied, “Grandfather dies, father dies, son dies.”<br />
The monk, confused, asked how this could be happiness.<br />
The master explained, “This is the natural order. Any other way would
bring great suffering.”</p>

<p>In our relentless pursuit of happiness, we have perhaps forgotten what
the ancients knew: that happiness is not a destination but a by-product
of a life well-lived. The modern obsession with happiness has created a
peculiar paradox: the more desperately we chase it, the more it eludes
us. Perhaps true contentment lies not in the chase, but in the
acceptance of life’s full spectrum of experiences, including those
moments of divine discontent that make us uniquely human.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be
honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that
you have lived and lived well.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
