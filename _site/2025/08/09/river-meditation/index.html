    <p>The river knows nothing
of its destination—
only the pull of becoming,
the ancient conversation
between stone and flow.</p>

<p>Each bend writes a question
in the grammar of earth,
each rapid punctuates
the long sentence of its journey
from mountain to sea.</p>

<p>I sit at its edge,
learning the patience
of water, how it finds
the lowest place
and makes it holy.</p>

<p>No hurry in its teaching,
no dogma in its doctrine—
just this endless demonstration
of how to move through the world:
persistent, yielding, whole.</p>

<p>The stones it polishes
were once mountains.
The canyons it carves
were once thought impossible.
Time is its only tool.</p>

<p>And I, brief visitor
to this liquid philosophy,
carry away a single lesson:
that the softest thing
conquers the hardest,</p>

<p>that true power flows
not from forcing
but from finding
the path of least resistance—
which is always the path of truth.</p>
