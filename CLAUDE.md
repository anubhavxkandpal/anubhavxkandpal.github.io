### 2. Automatic Image Assignment System
Modified `/Users/anubhav/Documents/GitHub/heartofreason/_layouts/category.html` to automatically:
- Use `featured_image` if manually set in front matter
- Fall back to first image found in post content using Jekyll liquid filters
- Hide image area if no image found or if image fails to load
- Added error handling with `onerror="this.parentElement.style.display='none'"`

### 3. Category Assignments Applied
All essays now have proper category assignments in their front matter:
- Format: `categories: [essays, beauty, consciousness]` (multiple categories allowed)
- Maintains original "essays" category while adding specific thematic categories

### 4. Beauty Category Expansion
- Renamed from "Beauty" to "Beauty & Reflection"
- Expanded description to include travel reflections and everyday beauty contemplations
- Added nature-focused and travel reflection essays to this category

## Technical Implementation Details

### Category Layout Logic
```liquid
{% if post.featured_image %}
  <!-- Use manual featured image -->
{% elsif post.content contains '![' and post.content contains '](https://' %}
  {% assign image_url = post.content | split: '](https://' | last | split: ')' | first | prepend: 'https://' %}
  <!-- Use first image from content -->
{% endif %}
```

### Category Assignment Pattern
Essays typically assigned to 1-3 categories based on content themes:
- All essays retain "essays" base category
- Added thematic categories: beauty, society, consciousness, ethics
- Multiple categories allowed for cross-cutting themes

## Current Site Structure
- 4 thematic categories effectively organize all philosophical essays
- Automatic image handling prevents broken image display issues
- Beauty category now encompasses aesthetic philosophy, travel reflections, and nature contemplations
- All category pages display properly with first images from posts when available
