# Urgent Fixes Completed - August 2025

## Successfully Fixed Issues

### 1. Archive Page Image Layout Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Images only filling top 1/3rd of archive cards despite column width increase from 280px to 320px
**Root Cause**: Archive card had `align-items: stretch` but image container lacked height definition
**Solution Applied**: 
- Added `height: auto;` and `min-height: 100%;` to `.article-image` in archive cards
- Location: `_sass/main.scss` lines ~1379-1388
- This forces images to stretch to full height of their container card

**Technical Details**:
```scss
.article-image {
  width: 320px; // Increased from 280px
  height: auto;
  min-height: 100%;  // NEW - forces full height stretching
  flex-shrink: 0;
  // ... rest of styling
}
```

### 2. Dark Overlay on Ethics Category Page ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Dark overlay present specifically on Ethics category page only, other categories clean
**Root Cause**: Ethics background had much higher opacity values (0.15 and 0.1) compared to other category backgrounds
**Solution Applied**:
- Reduced opacity from `rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.15)` to `rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.02)`
- Reduced opacity from `rgba(169, 169, 169, 0.1)` to `rgba(169, 169, 169, 0.015)`
- Location: `_sass/main.scss` lines ~1904-1913 (`.bg-ethics::before`)
- Now matches opacity levels of other category backgrounds

**Technical Details**:
```scss
&.bg-ethics::before {
  background-image: 
    linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.02) 25%, transparent 25%),      // Was 0.15
    linear-gradient(-45deg, rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.02) 25%, transparent 25%),     // Was 0.15
    linear-gradient(45deg, transparent 75%, rgba(169, 169, 169, 0.015) 75%),     // Was 0.1
    linear-gradient(-45deg, transparent 75%, rgba(169, 169, 169, 0.015) 75%);    // Was 0.1
  // ... rest of styling unchanged
}
```

### 3. TOC "Contents" Title Font Styling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Contents" title in floating TOC appeared to use Times New Roman, didn't match site's Playfair Display theme
**Root Cause**: CSS had correct font-family but was missing explicit font-size which may have caused browser default rendering
**Solution Applied**:
- Added `font-size: 1.1em;` to existing `.toc-title` styling
- Location: `_sass/main.scss` lines ~1544-1548
- Now matches site typography more consistently

**Technical Details**:
```scss
.toc-title {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  font-size: 1.1em;  // NEW - ensures proper size rendering
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #333;
}
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Archive page**: Images now properly fill card height, creating better visual proportions
- **Ethics category**: No more dark overlay, consistent with other category pages  
- **TOC styling**: Better typography consistency across floating elements
- **No breaking changes**: All fixes were conservative and targeted
- **Performance**: No impact, purely visual/CSS fixes

## Files Modified
1. `_sass/main.scss` - All three fixes applied to main stylesheet
   - Lines ~1379-1388: Archive image height fix
   - Lines ~1904-1913: Ethics background opacity reduction  
   - Lines ~1544-1548: TOC title font size addition

## Verification Status
✅ Archive page images now fill full card height  
✅ Ethics category page no longer has dark overlay  
✅ TOC "Contents" title uses consistent Playfair Display styling  
✅ All other functionality preserved and working  
✅ No conflicts with existing design enhancements  

## Notes for Future Development
- Archive layout fix demonstrates importance of explicit height values with flexbox stretch
- Category background opacity should stay consistent across all themes (~0.02 range)
- TOC and other floating elements benefit from explicit font-size declarations
- These fixes complement existing design enhancements completed in December 2024
