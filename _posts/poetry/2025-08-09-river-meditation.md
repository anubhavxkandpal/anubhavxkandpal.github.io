The river knows nothing
of its destination—
only the pull of becoming,
the ancient conversation
between stone and flow.

Each bend writes a question
in the grammar of earth,
each rapid punctuates
the long sentence of its journey
from mountain to sea.

I sit at its edge,
learning the patience
of water, how it finds
the lowest place
and makes it holy.

No hurry in its teaching,
no dogma in its doctrine—
just this endless demonstration
of how to move through the world:
persistent, yielding, whole.

The stones it polishes
were once mountains.
The canyons it carves
were once thought impossible.
Time is its only tool.

And I, brief visitor
to this liquid philosophy,
carry away a single lesson:
that the softest thing
conquers the hardest,

that true power flows
not from forcing
but from finding
the path of least resistance—
which is always the path of truth.
