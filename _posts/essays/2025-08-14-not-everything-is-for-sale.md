Have you ever tried to buy real, pure honey lately? It's harder than
you'd think. Yesterday, whilst hunting for honey at our local shops, I
stumbled upon a bitter truth about our modern markets—one that's been
staring us in the face all along.

Real honey isn’t really on the market anymore. So many people want honey
and to fill that demand they made honey mixed with sugar syrup or
jaggery. It has gotten so bad that some honey collectors go to the hives
and come back with this mixed honey—covering their tracks right at the
source.

The numbers tell us the same: according to recent scientific studies,
approximately 75% of honey samples from retail markets worldwide showed
signs of filtration and adulteration. What was once nature's pure gift
has become another victim of mass production.

## When Pure Becomes Rare: The Hidden Cost of Demand

This made me think—what if we are just living this fantasy that
everything is for sale? Of course there is real honey out there. Of
course one can buy it, but it is getting increasingly harder to find.
The demands of the modern consumerist market are somehow stifling the
production of real things and more fakes are emerging which just fill in
the demand.

The world has changed. Our free market system has now ceased to create
more opportunity but in fact has created more illusion. We thought we’d
be sharing more goods but we’re sharing bad fakes—forced to create bad
fakes in order to make sure the demand doesn’t go to waste. For one
thing our economic system has given us, is this sense “Why not make
money off of this?” Let’s just capitalise on everything, regardless of
ethics. Like bees transforming nectar into honey, we too transform raw
materials into products. But unlike bees, we often compromise the
essence of what we create in service of quantity over quality.

Let’s return to the honey seller. This person’s task of harvesting pure
honey and then selling it at the price agreed by the market isn’t
working out so well. People want 500 jars a month and they can only make
a 100. Of course, they can’t make the bees work overtime. So what does
one do? Their ethics will be guided by their circumstance—they might
have a dependent family, a sick parent or a house in dire need of
repair. So they will meet the demand of 500 jars but by cutting corners.

In the rules of supply and demand that should run economics, this person
should be paid the amount of 500 jars for a 100 jars because there just
isn’t that much supply. Most would disagree because we want our things
at the price we’ve always got them. A little inflation here and there
sneaks under our radars. But let’s look at the honey sellers, they only
have a 100 jars worth of real honey—that’s their limit. If the demand is
at the same price then they have to either choose to meet it by cutting
corners, or just sell a 100 jars and tell 400 people to come next month.

In this way, however, they’re not only selling themselves short, they’re
failing to capitalize on the 400 people at their doorstep willing to pay
for honey. Now, the honey seller thinks, people don’t really know the
difference between real and adulterated honey? So why not, give people
what they want in a way they can’t tell the difference. Most of us have
not worked firsthand with a beehive and eaten pure, raw honey so we
don’t know the difference. We might think we know but we don’t even know
how many times we’ve been fooled in the past by almost-original
products.

Here lies the modern paradox: authenticity becomes a luxury when
survival is at stake. As philosopher Michael Sandel notes:

> "Markets don't only allocate goods; they also express and promote certain
> attitudes toward the goods being exchanged."

What attitudes are we
promoting when we demand nature's bounty at unnatural prices?

The honey seller’s ethics will not waver at mixing the honey with sugar
syrup. They need the money and people are not willing to compensate them
fairly for real honey. They could take another path and just not sell
the honey, keep it for themselves. But unfortunately, we can’t survive
on just honey.  
Is this wrong? Is this right? Unfortunately, this is just life. Of
course, it has something to do with capitalism but not as much as we’d
like to think. People have always operated first and foremost in
self-interest.

## Beyond the Jar: Ethics in a World of Substitutes

As Aristotle once observed:

> "To give away money is an easy matter and in any man's power. But to decide
> to whom to give it, and how large, and when, and for what purpose and how,
> is neither in every man's power nor an easy matter."

Similarly, to produce purely for profit is simple; to
balance ethics with survival is infinitely more complex.

We as human beings have an innate drive for survival and whatever the
circumstances, we will push, with an extra force, at our conditions in
order to survive. We are never completely independent so we will also
make great strides to make sure those dependent on us also survive. To
fault any person for cutting corners in the attempt to make a living, to
prolong their existence, is in my opinion an immoral act.

We often make this judgement from a place of safety and relative
affluence. Clearly, we who judge people of cutting corners, do not have
to do so ourselves. This means our survival is guaranteed enough that
don’t have to push against circumstance. However, we falsely project our
conditions onto those who are facing an entirely different reality. It’s
something to think about because in our daily lives we are not exposed
to the struggles and challenges of the lives of others. That, too, is
normal.

Consider the bee colony itself: when resources are scarce, they don't
compromise on the quality of their honey—they simply produce less. But
they don't have mouths to feed beyond their hive, no children to send to
school, no landlords demanding rent. Their economics is pure, while ours
is muddied by the complexity of human needs and desires.

I will leave you with a quote by Oscar Wilde that not only exemplifies
my point but adds to it.

> "Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others
> to live as one wishes to live. And unselfishness is letting other
> people's lives alone, not interfering with them. Selfishness always aims
> at creating around it an absolute uniformity of type. Unselfishness
> recognizes infinite variety of type as a delightful thing, accepts it,
> acquiesces in it, enjoys it. It is not selfish to think for oneself. A
> man who does not think for himself does not think at all. It is grossly
> selfish to require of one's neighbor that he should think in the same
> way, and hold the same opinions. Why should he? If he can think, he will
> probably think differently. If he cannot think, it is monstrous to
> require thought of any kind from him. A red rose is not selfish because
> it wants to be a red rose. It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all
> the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses."

Writings](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/66058139)**

In the end, perhaps the story of honey is the story of all things pure
in an impure world. The question isn't whether everything is for sale,
but whether anything can remain pure by the very markets meant to
distribute it. Like the bees themselves, we must find a way to balance
the collective good with individual necessity. As we seek answers, we
might find wisdom in observing the bees themselves: they take only what
they need and give back more than they take.
