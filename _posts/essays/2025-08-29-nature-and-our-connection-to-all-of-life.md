title: "Nature And Our Connection To All Of Life"

excerpt: "This essay explores our deep, often forgotten, connection to the natural world. It questions the modern illusion of separation from nature, arguing that our well-being is intrinsically linked to the health of the planet. Drawing on indigenous wisdom and scientific insights, it calls for a renewed sense of kinship with all life."

Even death as the necessary promoter of life is a wonder in itself. And
as we know, but don’t often admit, all life ends in death. The pessimist
in me says: ‘Maybe this was the way we were supposed to go.’ But the
realist in me chooses to believe there is a greater understanding that
guides us and life on this planet. If this is the way it is meant to go,
then so be it. Folly might be the scripture mankind has yet to read and
understand. Maybe this is the process towards something good. Like the
storms, we see as the wrath of the Gods, this too may be a storm passing
through our souls. Like all storms, it won't last forever—and neither
will we.

Let's reawaken our reverence for nature and our connection to all life.
Let's start seeing the world as alive and participate in its aliveness.
To conclude I will leave you with one of my favorite poems "Wild Geese"
by Mary Oliver:

> You do not have to be good.
>
> You do not have to walk on your knees
>
> for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
>
> You only have to let the soft animal of your body
>
> love what it loves.
>
> Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
>
> Meanwhile the world goes on.
>
> Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
>
> are moving across the landscapes,
>
> over the prairies and the deep trees,
>
> the mountains and the rivers.
>
> Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
>
> are heading home again.
>
> Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
>
> the world offers itself to your imagination,
>
> calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting
>
> over and over announcing your place
>
> in the family of things.

— Mary Oliver, "Wild Geese"
