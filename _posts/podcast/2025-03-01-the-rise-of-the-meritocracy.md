In this episode, I explore *Michael Young*'s eerily prophetic 1958 satire "**The Rise of the Meritocracy**" and its disturbing relevance to our modern world. Young's dystopian vision—where intelligence becomes the ultimate currency and society fractures along cognitive lines—serves as a mirror to our contemporary obsession with metrics, rankings, and individual achievement.

I examine how our educational institutions have become *factories of standardisation* rather than *gardens of wisdom*, and how the workforce increasingly rewards technical skill while devaluing essential human qualities. The episode goes into the dangerous myth that success is purely a product of talent and effort, ignoring **the tilted playing fields** that define our reality.

As populist movements gain momentum worldwide, I reflect on Young's most chilling prediction: that the growing alienation of those deemed "less intelligent" might ultimately lead to the collapse of meritocracy itself. Join me in considering how we might forge a more sustainable future—one that values compassion and creativity as highly as intellect, before Young's **satirical prophecy** becomes our lived reality.
