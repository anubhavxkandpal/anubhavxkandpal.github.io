### "We give so much emphasis on 'finding your way','finding your passion' that we inevitably feel lost. Maybe this feeling of lostness is here to help us?"

A sense of feeling lost can find us at any time in our lives. But what is it trying to tell us? In this episode we explore how this feeling may be a guide for us to explore. We cannot find something that isn't lost, so in the same way, a deeper understanding of ourselves begins with a feeling that calls us to adventure.
