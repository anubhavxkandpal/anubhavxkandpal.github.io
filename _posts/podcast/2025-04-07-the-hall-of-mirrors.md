In this episode we discuss whether it is healthy to allow any social media reel to dictate how we see ourselves and our own worth.

When we look at our society today, we seem to be worshiping our own digital images. The selfie, the look in the video, the reflection on any shiny surface.

But what kind of perfection are we chasing? And are we doing the right thing by letting our self-obsession get out of hand?
