In this contemplative episode, I explore our complex relationship with money and why we pursue it with such desperation. Moving beyond simple criticisms of materialism, I examine how money transforms from a survival tool into something almost sacred in our lives. From the psychological inability to determine "enough," to how wealth reshapes our most intimate relationships, this episode dives into the paradoxes of prosperity.

I consider historical perspectives from Thorstein Veblen on conspicuous consumption and Max Weber on the religious dimensions of wealth accumulation, while reflecting on my personal journey away from the collective hypnosis of wealth pursuit. The episode also explores alternative status systems beyond money, and offers practical approaches to developing healthier relationships with wealth.

Whether you're questioning your own relationship with money or simply curious about the forces driving global inequality, this episode offers thoughtful perspectives on one of humanity's most complicated relationships.
