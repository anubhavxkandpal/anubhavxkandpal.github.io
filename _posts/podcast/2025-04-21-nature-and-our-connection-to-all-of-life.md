In this reflective episode, we explore the profound yet often forgotten relationship between humans and the natural world. 

Beginning with a simple act of reverence—my grandmother offering water to the rising sun—we delve into how modern life has severed our connection to nature's mysteries. Through the lens of Rachel Carson's poetic science and ancient wisdom, we examine how reconnecting with wonder might be essential not just for our spiritual well-being, but for the planet's survival. As climate crises loom and economic systems strain Earth's resources, this episode invites listeners to rediscover the awe that might save us from ourselves.
