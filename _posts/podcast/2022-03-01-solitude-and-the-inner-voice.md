## "There is only one solitude, and it is large and not easy to bear." - Rainer Maria Rilke

If we see our egos are a living, breathing interface between the world and our higher selves then we can see that we need to connect to the world in order to express ourselves but we also need to connect to our higher selves in order to know what to express. This is where the importance of solitude comes in.
